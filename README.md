# Fungi_PairedEnd_QIIME2
A repository to optimise the processing of ITS (fungi) paired-end reads in qiime2, considering particularly the high levels of within-species variability in the ITS region compared to the 16S region.

This script has been developed for the Applied and Environmental Microbiology Group, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia.

This pipeline has been developed by taking into account some of the recommendations from the following publications:
